We’re almost always hiring Software Developers on all our teams across CoverMyMeds.

We do our best to learn as much as we can about your skill set and interests, and at the end of our process, we select which teams we feel will set you up for success right away.

Our Process
Phone interview with one of our Recruiters
One of our Recruiters will set up a phone call with you that typically lasts around 45 minutes. They’ll start by answering any questions you have about CoverMyMeds to ensure you get what you need out of the chat. This interview is meant to be conversational and will adapt, based on your skill set and interests. Our Recruiter will introduce topics that are important to our development teams and you’ll share what experience and opinions you have in those areas. Topics may include things like security, reliability, REST, teaching others, learning new skills, our core values, etc.
Live coding interview with one of our Software Developers
One of our Software Developers will join you for a video and screen share meeting that typically lasts around 1.5-2 hours. They will send you 3 different coding exercises to walk through different areas of the stack. The first coding exercise will be client-side, the second will be backend and the third will be a few SQL operations. They will spend 30-40 minutes live on each exercise with you. For any work you two decide should be finished up after that 30-40 minutes, you’ll have the opportunity to complete it on your own time and send it back to them. We’d like you to approach this meeting as if you’re mentoring our Software Developer. We encourage you to explain your approach, be collaborative and ask questions.

Code day with one of our development hiring teams
Our code day is meant to be a mini day in the life of our Software Developer role. You'll join us for half a day, work with one of our teams and build an application. You’ll do some preparation work ahead of time to get your application in a good starting point. During your code day, you’ll work with our team to complete the project. At the end of your visit, our team will regroup with you to wrap things up. They’ll start by reviewing your project through a demo of the application and a look at your code. They’ll then ask some general questions about your background and interests to get to know you better. They’ll end by giving you plenty of time to get all of your questions answered. We’re happy to conduct this step virtually for our remote candidates to get a good sense for how a remote Software Developer role would feel.
A quick note: If you’d prefer different logistics to accommodate your individual needs and set you up for success, let us know how we can help and we'll do our best. We want this process to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for you.
