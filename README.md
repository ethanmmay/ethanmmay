### Ethan May - Software Developer
Hello! I'm Ethan May, a Software Developer in Meridian, Idaho. I've been pursuing software development since early in high school and I'm continuing my journey with Boise State University, pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. 

So far I've reached intermediate level with Java, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript. I'm excited to learn more and secure a career in building, training and perfecting neural networks.
